## Parallel-Huffman-Encoding

Huffman encoding is used widely for lossless compression of length codes and multiple media format. Based on the data, the algorithm can easily get exhausted as the data augments. This project implements the parallel solution to the famour Huffman encoding problem as presented in the paper(https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8367376)

This project is a part of my research during my undergraduate progam when I worked as a Research Assistant under "Prof. Jayaprabha Kanase". Our research majorly focused on Applications of High Performance Computng to improve real world problems.
